About the code (designed for Python 2.7): 

An implementation and adaptation of the 1972 Schwab and Knopoff Rayleigh wave dispersion algorithm, applied to near surface exploration.
The 'contintental model' is used for rayleigh wave dispersion. Figure 11 forms the basis.
A basic inversion program is included as well using Python.

This tool will hopefully be sufficient for generating 1D shear wave profiles during small field work experiments.
